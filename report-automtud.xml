	<p>The automtud script will allow a FreeBSD machine to send
	jumbo frames to machines that support them, while using normal
	sized frames for other machines.</p>

	<p>There are various advantages to using jumbo frames, such as
	reduced protocol overhead.  It also means that TCP streams will
	not be segmented as much (though TSO helps) and in cases where
	LRO doesn't work well, less packets will be received.</p>

	<p>The script does not currently restore the state of the system
	it was in before starting.  This means that you'll have to manually
	change the interface MTU, and manually delete host routes.</p>

    <help>
      <task>Fix up various ethernet drivers to better support jumbo frames.
	Most ethernet drivers, though supporting scatter/gather, use a
	physically contiguous zone which can cause resource shortages.</task>

      <task>More testing is needed to ensure that things behave as
	expected.  This means that when running the script, all machines
	work as expected w/o slow down or connectivity issues.  Check
	`vmstat -z | grep mbuf' to ensure this isn't a problem with running
	out of jumbo_9k or jumbo_16k buffers do to ethernet driver
	issue.</task>
